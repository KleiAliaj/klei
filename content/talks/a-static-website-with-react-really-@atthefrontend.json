Why a static website? Because static is the new dynamic. It’s\nunhackable. It’s performant. And it has more to offer than you can imagine."]},"\n",{"tag":"p","children":["But the thing is: you work with the React ecosystem and CSS Modules or CSS-in-JS\neveryday and don’t want to write boring HTML templates and dangerous CSS\nselectors. You are a modern front-end developer and you don't really want to\ninstall Ruby or Python to build silly static HTML pages."]},"\n",{"tag":"p","children":["You just want to use the tools you've grown to love. You want to get the same DX\n(developer experience) that React ecosystem offers you on a daily basis. You\nwant to enjoy hot loading while you will work on your website."]},"\n",{"tag":"p","children":["What if I told you that you could reuse all the unit tested React components\nthat you will find on npm to make your isomorphic/universal static website?
