Remember CSS without variables, math & friends ? Ouch. Preprocessors saved us,
until we get bigger & bigger CSS to maintain. BEM saved us again to prevent
crappy code, but we still need preprocessors. CSS specs, even if they are slow,
will bring lots of features than will deprecate preprocessors. Will we be able
to use that in 2020 ? What if we could write the same code today ?
