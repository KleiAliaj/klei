Imagine you need a static website for a small website, a documentation or a
corporate website. Why a static website? Because static is the new dynamic. It’s
unhackable. It’s performant. And it has more to offer than you can imagine.

But the thing is: you work with the React ecosystem and CSS Modules or CSS-in-JS
everyday and don’t want to write boring HTML templates and dangerous CSS
selectors. You are a modern front-end developer and you don't really want to
install Ruby or Python to build silly static HTML pages.

You just want to use the tools you've grown to love. You want to get the same DX
(developer experience) that React ecosystem offers you on a daily basis. You
want to enjoy hot loading while you will work on your website.

What if I told you that you could reuse all the unit tested React components
that you will find on npm to make your isomorphic/universal static website? What
if I told you that this website will be static but dynamic at the same time?
What if I told you that you can even offer the UX of a progressive web app?
