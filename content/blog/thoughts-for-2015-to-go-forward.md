title: Thoughts for 2015 to go forward

Here is a quick post to start 2015. I will just drop some thoughts (as reminder
for myself).

**I want to be the change I want to see in others.**

## What I want to do in a near future

* share more by writting more (more shorter posts - like this one)
* read more books (my new iPad will probably help)
* start to draw again (not just technical drawing for DIY stuff)
* build durable stuff (I hate cheap stuff that break within a minute)
* respect more and more every life forms (avoid all toxic/chemical shits that
  are everywhere, hello nanoparticles)
* adapt myself to the environnement I live in (not the opposite)
* give life?

## What I will stop to do (or apply a higher rate limit)

* having my main activity on a chair (by building my own rebel desktop)
* feeding trolls (by focusing on going forward - others will probably look, wait
  and see what happens)
* having conflicts (by keeping peace inside of me)
* discuss form more than substance (no time to lose)
* use google (because it really scares me)

## Development related stuff I want to do

* continue to focus on open source projects (shared "intelligence")
* use the terminal more (to end up like a hacker)
* automate more and more (all painful tasks)
* work on UI automated tests (because too few people do that)

I probably forget some interesting stuff. But it's better to write this short
post than forgetting everything (by not doing this post).
